* Part 1: Introduction to adaptive designs in Phase II trials.
* Part 2: Introduction to adaptive designs in Phase III trials.
* Part 3: Response-adaptive designs in Phase II trials.
* Part 4: Response-adaptive designs in Phase II trials (Case study and software).
* Part 5: Adaptive designs with sample size re-estimation in Phase III trials (Methodology and examples).
* Part 6: Adaptive designs with sample size re-estimation in Phase III trials (Case study and software).
* Part 7: Adaptive designs with treatment selection in Phase III trials (Methodology and examples).
* Part 8: Adaptive designs with treatment selection in Phase III trials (Case study and software).
* Part 9: Adaptive designs with population selection in Phase III trials (Methodology and examples).
* Part 10: Adaptive designs with population selection in Phase III trials (Case study and software).

# Clinical trial simulation software

The R package (MedianaDesigner) is used throughout this training course to illustrate the process of designing adaptive Phase II and Phase III trials.  

For more information on this package, visit [Mediana's web site](http://www.mediana.us/free-software) and review the [online manual](https://medianasoft.github.io/MedianaDesigner). 

The latest stable version of the package can be downloaded from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MedianaDesigner/index.html).
