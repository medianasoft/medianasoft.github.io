# About the company

[Mediana LLC](http://www.mediana.us) provides biostatistical consulting services and develops software tools to implement innovative trial designs and advanced statistical methods for clinical trials.

# Open-source software

Mediana has been an active contributor to the development of free and open-source software for clinical trials, including tools for clinical trial simulations and for designing Phase II and Phase III trials. 

# MedianaDesigner (R package)

This package supports efficient simulation-based power and sample size calculations for a broad class of late-stage clinical trials. 

The latest stable version of the package can be downloaded from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MedianaDesigner/index.html) and the latest development version can be found on [Github](https://github.com/medianasoft/MedianaDesigner). 

For more information on this package, visit [Mediana's web site](http://www.mediana.us/free-software) and review the [online manual](https://medianasoft.github.io/MedianaDesigner). 

# MCPModPack (R package)

This package provides an efficient implementation of the MCPMod (Multiple Comparisons and Modeling) method to support a simulation-based design and analysis of dose-finding trials with normally distributed, binary and count endpoints.

The latest production version of the package is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MCPModPack/index.html).  The latest development version can be found on [Github](https://github.com/medianainc/MCPModPack).

# Online training programs

Online training programs on key topics in clinical trial statistics and clinical trial simulation can be found on [Mediana's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAQUAsQxxnzje4rEdJ4870Q).
